## Voice & Tone
- Warm, knowledgeable, never condescending
- Speak to therapists as smart professionals who just haven't had time to learn this yet
- Use therapy-adjacent metaphors where natural (growth, practice, process)
- Avoid jargon, hype, and "hustle culture" language
- Emphasize safety, ethics, and client care alongside business growth

## Brand Story
> It's not a rocket. It's not a chart going up and to the right. It's a living thing, growing at its own pace. That's what your practice is — and that's how we think about AI. Not as a disruption, but as a tool that grows with you.
